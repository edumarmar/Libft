About Open Libft

An open source library with over 200 functions. This library has been used throughout my academic career in 42 Madrid. It incorporates very useful functions, including binary trees, linked lists, stacks, arrays, bit manipulation, and more. By developing this library, I gained a thorough understanding of data structures, algorithms, unit testing, continuous integration, troubleshooting, and proper documentation.
