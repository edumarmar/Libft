## Description

This library has been used throughout my academic career in 42 Madrid. It incorporates very useful functions, including linked lists, stacks, arrays, bit manipulation, and more. By developing this library, I gained a thorough understanding of data structures, algorithms, unit testing, continuous integration, troubleshooting, and proper documentation.
